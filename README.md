# Traveling-Salesman-Problem

TSP can be quickly summarized by assuming that there are N cities, with a cost of travel from every city to every other city defined. TSP asks us to find the lowest cost path from a given city back to that city that passes through every other city once and only once.
In this project, I implemented a genetic algorithm to find a solution to TSP problems.
